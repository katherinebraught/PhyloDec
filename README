Dependencies:
I used Python 3.8.2.
I was able to install pysat python library on pyrite using:
$ pip install --user python-sat

Running the program:
The program takes in an input file that contains the matrix with the taxa names and can be run as:
./PhyloDec matrixFileName -arg
where arg can be d, a, or r where 
-d means we check if the matrix is decisive
-a means we add and remove rows to find a solution
-r means to we only remove rows 

Example:
$ ./PhyloDec.sh path-to-data/matrix-filename -d
$ ./PhyloDec.sh path-to-data/matrix-filename -a
$ ./PhyloDec.sh path-to-data/matrix-filename -r

Output files:
If the program takes a file named "matrix" as its input, it will always output the following files:
matrixStripped - matrix without taxa names
matrixReduced - matrix with repeated rows removed
matrixReducedResults - decisive matrix in reduced forms
matrixFinalResults - decisive matrix with duplicate rows added back in (if they are present in the reduced decisive matrix)
matrixSummary.txt - file containing info about result sizes and timing results
